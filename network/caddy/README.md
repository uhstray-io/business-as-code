Install xcaddy
```bash

```

Build Caddy with the Cloudflare DNS module
```bash
xcaddy build latest --with https://github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare
```

## NextCloud Configuration

**Configuration Note**
> On a different server (in container or not)
Use the <mark>private ip-address</mark> of the host that shall be running AIO. So e.g. `private.ip.address.of.aio.server:$APACHE_PORT` instead of `localhost:$APACHE_PORT`. If you are not sure how to retrieve that, you can run: `ip a | grep "scope global" | head -1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's|/.*||'` on the server that shall be running AIO (the commands only work on Linux).
